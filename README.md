## Features
**Admin Panel**: Login functionality for administrators to access administrative features.
**Registration**: Ability to register new students and teachers.
**Deletion**: Functionality to delete existing student and teacher accounts.
**Secure Authentication**: Utilizes username and password authentication for admin login.

## Tools Used
**Python**: Programming language used for application development.
**MySQL**: Database management system for storing user data.
**mysql-connector-python**: Python library for connecting to MySQL database.
**IDE**: VSCode.

## Tech Stack
**Frontend**: Command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.
**Backend**: Python for application logic and MySQL for database management.

## Stages to Complete the Project
1. **Setup Database**: Create a MySQL database named `college` and a table named `users` with columns for `username`, `password`, and `privilege`.
2. **Develop Application Logic**: Write Python code to implement the admin login functionality, registration of new students and teachers, and    deletion of existing student and teacher accounts.
3. **Test Application**: Perform thorough testing of the application to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
4. **Refinement**: Refine the codebase as necessary, addressing any bugs or issues encountered during testing.
5. **Documentation**: Write documentation including a README file to provide information about the project, its features, and how to use it.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy the application for use within the college administration.
